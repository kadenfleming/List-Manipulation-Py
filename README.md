List Manipulation Program Assignment

Create a Python program that allows users to interactively manipulate a list. The program will perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of items. Users can add, update, remove, print the list, or quit the program.  The list can hold information up to you.
Requirements:

        The program should start with an empty list.
        The program must continuously prompt the user with options: add, update, remove, print the list, or quit.
        If the user selects "add," the program should prompt for the item to add and add it to the list.
        If the user selects "update," the program should prompt whether to update by item or index and then update accordingly.
        If the user selects "remove," the program should prompt for the item or index to remove and remove it from the list.
        If the user selects "print the list," the program should print the current list.
        If the user selects "quit," the program should end the loop and proceed to the final step.
        Once the user decides to quit, the program should print out the final version of the list.
